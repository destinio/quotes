As a leader in my field I deal with and help others with the following areas. I love using quotes as examples to get myself and others motivated.

We are always dealing with **change** in work and in our everyday lives. A lot of the time failure is a result of said change and I believe we should all welcome change because it gives us opportunity to fail and we can not succeed with out failing, in most cases ;)

The following are quotes that help me deal with this aspect of life. Enjoy :)
